/**
 Replaces a tap gesture recognizer and a pan gesture recognizer with just one
 gesture recognizer.

 Lifecycle:
 * Touch begins, state -> .began (all other touches are completely ignored)
 * Touch moves, state -> .changed
 * Touch ends
   * If touch moved more than 10px away from the origin at some point, then
     `hasExceededTapThreshold` was set to `true`. Target may use this to
     distinguish a pan from a tap when the gesture has ended and act
     accordingly.

 This behavior is better than using a regular UIPanGestureRecognizer because
 that class ignores the first ~20px of the touch while it figures out if you
 "really" want to pan. This is a drawing program, so that's not good.
